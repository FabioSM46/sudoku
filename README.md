# Sudoku Game

This is a Sudoku game developed using vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The game utilizes DOM manipulation to create an interactive user experience.

## How to Play

 - Open the [link](https://fabiosm46.github.io/sudoku/) in your web browser.
 - Select the difficulty.
 - The game board will be displayed with some pre-filled numbers.
 - Click on an empty cell to select it and use your keyboard's number
   keys (1-9) to enter a number into the selected cell. Or just click an
   empty cell and select the number from the virtual keyboard at the
   bottom.
 - If the number is valid, it will be placed in the cell.
 - If the number violates any Sudoku rules, an error will be added to the counter.
 - Continue filling the cells until the entire board is filled
   correctly.
 - Once all cells are filled correctly, a Game Over page will be displayed.

## Credits

The Sudoku solving algorithm used in this game was developed by phasing17 from the page https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-sudoku-generator/ . The algorithm provides a solution to the Sudoku puzzle and ensures that the generated game boards are solvable.
The game UI and logic were implemented by me, FabioSM46.
